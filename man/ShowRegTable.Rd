\title{Format regression results in medically decent format}
\usage{
ShowRegTable(model, exp = TRUE, digits = 2, pDigits = 3,
  printToggle = TRUE, quote = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Regression model result objects that have the summary and confint methods.}

\item{exp}{TRUE by default. You need to specify exp = FALSE if your model is has the indentity link function (linear regression, etc).}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to print for the main part.}

\item{pDigits}{Number of digits to print for the p-values.}

\item{printToggle}{Whether to print the output. If FLASE, no output is created, and a matrix is invisibly returned.}

\item{quote}{Whether to show everything in quotes. The default is FALSE. If TRUE, everything including the row and column names are quoted so that you can copy it to Excel easily.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing what you see is returned invisibly. You can capture it by assignment to an object.
}
\description{
It shows the regression result in the HR [95\% CI] p-value format, which is usually the form used in medical research papers.

\examples{
## Load
library(tableone)

## Load Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Data
library(survival)
data(pbc)
## Check variables
head(pbc)

## Fit a Cox regression model
objCoxph <- coxph(formula = Surv(time, status == 2) ~ trt + age + albumin + ascites,
                  data    = pbc)

## Show the simple table
ShowRegTable(objCoxph)

## Show with quote to ease copy and paste
ShowRegTable(objCoxph, quote = TRUE)
