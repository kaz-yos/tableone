\usage{
\method{print}{CatTable}(x, digits = 1, pDigits = 3, quote = FALSE,
  missing = FALSE, explain = TRUE, printToggle = TRUE, noSpaces = FALSE,
  format = c("fp", "f", "p", "pf")[1], showAllLevels = FALSE,
  cramVars = NULL, test = TRUE, exact = NULL, CrossTable = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The result of a call to the \code{\link{CreateCatTable}} function.}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to print in the table.}

\item{pDigits}{Number of digits to print for p-values.}

\item{quote}{Whether to show everything in quotes. The default is FALSE. If TRUE, everything including the row and column names are quoted so that you can copy it to Excel easily.}

\item{missing}{Whether to show missing data information (not implemented yet, placeholder)}

\item{explain}{Whether to add explanation to the variable names, i.e., (\%) is added to the variable names when percentage is shown.}

\item{printToggle}{Whether to print the output. If FLASE, no output is created, and a matrix is invisibly returned.}

\item{noSpaces}{Whether to remove spaces added for alignment. Use this option if you prefer to align numbers yourself in other software.}

\item{format}{The default is "fp" frequency (percentage). You can also choose from "f" frequency only, "p" percentage only, and "pf" percentage (frequency).}

\item{showAllLevels}{Whether to show all levels. FALSE by default, i.e., for 2-level categorical variables, only the higher level is shown to avoid redundant information.}

\item{cramVars}{A character vector to specify the two-level categorical variables, for which both levels should be shown in one row.}

\item{test}{Whether to show the p-values. TRUE by default. If FALSE, only the numerical summaries are shown.}

\item{exact}{A character vector to specify the variables for which the p-values should be those of exact tests. By default all p-values are from large sample approximation tests (chisq.test).}

\item{CrossTable}{Whether to show the cross table objects held internally using gmodels::CrossTable function. This will give an output similar to the PROC FREQ in SAS.}

\item{...}{For compatibility with generic. Ignored.}
}
\value{
It is mainly for printing the result. But this function does return a matrix containing what you see in the output invisibly. You can assign it to an object to save it.

\description{
This is the \code{print} method for the \code{CatTable} class objects created by \code{\link{CreateCatTable}} function.
}
\examples{
## Load
library(tableone)

## Load Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Data
library(survival)
data(pbc)
## Check variables
head(pbc)

## Create an overall table for categorical variables
catVars <- c("status","ascites","hepato","spiders","edema","stage")
catTableOverall <- CreateCatTable(vars = catVars, data = pbc)

## Simply typing the object name will invoke the print.CatTable method,
## which will show the sample size, frequencies and percentages.
## For 2-level variables, only the higher level is shown for simplicity.
catTableOverall

## If you need to show both levels for some 2-level factors, use cramVars
print(catTableOverall, cramVars = "hepato")

## Use the showAllLevels argument to see all levels for all variables.
print(catTableOverall, showAllLevels = TRUE)

## You can choose form frequencies ("f") and/or percentages ("p") or both.
## "fp" frequency (percentage) is the default. Row names change accordingly.
print(catTableOverall, format = "f")
print(catTableOverall, format = "p")

## To further examine the variables, use the summary.CatTable method,
## which will show more details.
summary(catTableOverall)

## The table can be stratified by one or more variables
catTableBySexTrt <- CreateCatTable(vars = catVars,
                                   strata = c("sex","trt"), data = pbc)

## print now includes p-values which are by default calculated by chisq.test.
## It is formatted at the decimal place specified by the pDigits argument
## (3 by default). It does <0.001 for you.
catTableBySexTrt

## The exact argument toggles the p-values to the exact test result from
## fisher.test. It will show which ones are from exact tests.
print(catTableBySexTrt, exact = "ascites")

## summary now includes both types of p-values
summary(catTableBySexTrt)

## If your work flow includes copying to Excel and Word when writing manuscripts,
## you may benefit from the quote argument. This will quote everything so that
## Excel does not mess up the cells.
print(catTableBySexTrt, exact = "ascites", quote = TRUE)

## If you want to center-align values in Word, use noSpaces option.
print(catTableBySexTrt, exact = "ascites", quote = TRUE, noSpaces = TRUE)
