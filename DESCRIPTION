Description: This package creates "Table 1", i.e., description of baseline
    patient characteristics, which is essential in every medical research. This
    package provides functions to create such summaries for continuous and
    categorical variables, optionally with subgroup comparisons. The package
    was inspired by and based on descriptive statistics functions in Deducer,
    a Java-based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package does not require GUI
    or Java, and intended for command-line users.
