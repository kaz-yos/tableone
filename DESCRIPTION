Description: Creates 'Table 1', i.e., description of baseline patient
    characteristics, which is essential in every medical research.
    Supports both continuous and categorical variables, as well as
    p-values and standardized mean differences. Weighted data are
    supported via the 'survey' package. See 'github' for a screen cast.
    'tableone' was inspired by descriptive statistics functions in
    'Deducer' , a Java-based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package
    does not require GUI or Java, and intended for command-line users.
