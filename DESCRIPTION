Description: Creates "Table 1", i.e., description of baseline patient
    characteristics, which is essential in every medical research.
    Supports both continuous and categorical variables, as well as
    p-values and standardized mean differences. Weighted data are
    supported via the survey package. See github for a screencast.
    tableone was inspired by descriptive statistics functions in
    Deducer , a Java-based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package
    does not require GUI or Java, and intended for command-line users.
