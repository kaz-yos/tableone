tableone 0.6.2 (2014-06-01)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* The testing of 1 x m table was problematic when a categorical
  variable only have one level. chisq.test() returns Chi-squared
  test for given probabilities (test for strata imbalance) in such
  cases. In this version, testing a 1 x m table always return NA,
  as test for a cross table is not defined in this context.

* Special thanks to Atsushi Shiraishi for reporting this issues.

* Unit testing with the testthat package was added for some
  functions. Thus, the testthat package was added as a suggested
  package.


tableone 0.6.1 (2014-06-01)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* The algorithm CreateCatTable used to detect variables to convert
  to factos had a bug. CreateCatTable was effectively (re-)converting
  all variables to factors, which deleted empty levels from factors
  and ordered factors.

* Special thanks to Atsushi Shiraishi for reporting this issues.


tableone 0.6.0 (2014-05-31)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* The CreateTableOne function automatically use all variables
  in the data frame given to the data argument, if the vars
  argument is empty.
* The printToggle argument added to ShowRegTable().


tableone 0.5.0 (2014-04-14)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* The noSpaces argument was added to print.* functions. This allows
  removal of spaces added for alignment using fixed-width fonts.
  Use this option if you prefer to align your table in other software.
  (Special thanks to Raja Sriswan Mamidi for suggestions)


tableone 0.4.0 (2014-03-30)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* The showAllLevels argument to show all levels of categorical
  variables regardless of numbers of levels was added to
  print.TableOne. Previously, it was only available in
  print.CatTable. To accommodate this feature, insertLevel argument
  to insert an empty level column was added to print.ContTable.
  (Special thanks to Yoshinobu Kanda for suggestions)


tableone 0.3.5 (2014-03-07)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* Fixed a problem with space insertion when empty strata are present.

* Thanks jomuller for bug reports and code suggestions for the
  following.

* Added more robust class assessment in CreateTableOne and
  CreateCatTable, which now handles ordered factors correctly.
  CreateTableOne also drops Surv object for safety.

* "Dropped due to unsupported class" message has been fixed to
  show variable names with spaces in between.


tableone 0.3.4 (2014-03-04)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* Added the Create* functions handling of all NA/NaN variables.
  These invalid variables are examined at the beginning and dropped
  with warning for safety.

* For the strata argument, variables with only one level is dropped
  with warning because these are meaningless, and caused data
  handling problems.


tableone 0.3.3 (2014-02-22)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* CreateTableOne now handles logical and chracter vectors correctly.
  They are handled as categorical variables, and passed to the
  CreateCatTable function. Variables that are none of numeric,
  integer, factor, logical, or character are dropped for safety.


tableone 0.3.2 (2014-02-18)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* DESCRIPTION changed for clarity. No functional changes.


tableone 0.3.1 (2014-02-18)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* NAMESPACE now includes import(e1071) and import(gmodels).

* DESCRIPTION now includes Imports e1071, gmodels and
  Suggests survival, instead of Depends...


tableone 0.3.0 (2014-02-17)
----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* CreateTableOne has a new factorVars argument, a character
  vector specifying numerically coded variables that should be
  treated as factors.

* The print method for the TableOne/CatTable class object has a
  new minMax argument, a logical value specifying whether to show
  median [min, max] instead of median [IQR] for nonnormal variables

* The print method for the TableOne/CatTable class object has a
  new cramVars argument, a character vector to specify which
  2-level factors to should have both levels presented in one row.


BUG FIXES

* Documentations were fixed to represent the current version.


tableone 0.2.1 (2014-02-15)
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES

* Documentations were fixed to represent the current version.


tableone 0.2.0 (2014-02-14)
----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* CreateTableOne and related print/summary methods were added.

* CreateTableOne can crate a table with both categorical and
  continuous variables.

* The print method can suppress printing by printToggle option.

BUG FIXES

* In the Roxygen part of the code, only at_export followed by nothing is used.


tableone 0.1.2 (2014-02-09)
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES

* Fixed incorrect specification of S3 method export.

* To make an object an S3 method and export it both at_S3method and at_export
  tags are needed in the Roxygen part of the code.

* Passed all the default tests by R CMD check file.tar.gz


tableone 0.1.1 (2014-02-09)
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES

* This version is to better conform to the CRAN standards.

* Documents are now included in


tableone 0.1.0 (2014-02-08)
----------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST DEVELOPMENTAL VERSION

* This is the first developmental version to be made public.

* tableone makes creation of "Table 1", description of baseline characteristics
  common in medical research papers easy.
